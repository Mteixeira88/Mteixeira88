### About me

<i>Programming makes my life better everyday. The pursuit for perfection and new things makes my self-learning will to never let me go frustrated with this area.</i>

### My work

#### Indie Apps

- ClipToCloud <img alt="" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-%5E10.15-red"> <img alt="" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/AppStore-1.0.1-green"> <img alt="" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/UiKit-blue">

ClipToCloud is a software that allows you to manage your clipboard in a polished and easy-to-use interface all around your Apple devices.

In this project I worked with a UX Designer, that helped me in the beggining designing the macOS app. The iOS app I did by myself. All implementation was done by me. This project uses Firebase (Firestore) as database. All clips are encrypted with CryptoSwift.

#### Professional apps

- Calendall <img alt="" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Disabled-red">

Calendall is the platform you asked not to miss any more events from your favorite artists.

In this project I worked with a UX Designer, that did all the design before I started implementing. I started alone implementing the code but after two weeks a Senior iOS developper come to help/teach me and it was when I we start using SwiftLint, Firebase for Analytics/Push Notifications and Fastlane integratio
